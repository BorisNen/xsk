Prerequisites Install Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface . Access to SAP BTP account (the Trial landscape can be accessed here ). Create HANA Cloud service instance in SAP BTP Cloud Foundry space. Create a separate HANA Cloud user that will be used from the XSK engine. Steps Set the SAP BTP Cloud Foundry API host: cf api <cloud-foundry-api-host> Log in to the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment with: cf login Create XSUAA service instance: Copy and paste the following content into xs-security.json : { \"xsappname\" : \"<applicationName>-xsuaa\" , \"tenant-mode\" : \"shared\" , \"scopes\" : [ { \"name\" : \"$XSAPPNAME.Developer\" , \"description\" : \"Developer scope\" }, { \"name\" : \"$XSAPPNAME.Operator\" , \"description\" : \"Operator scope\" } ], \"role-templates\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Developer\" , \"description\" : \"Developer related roles\" , \"scope-references\" : [ \"$XSAPPNAME.Developer\" ] }, { \"name\" : \"Operator\" , \"description\" : \"Operator related roles\" , \"scope-references\" : [ \"$XSAPPNAME.Operator\" ] } ], \"role-collections\" : [ { \"name\" : \"XSK Developer\" , \"description\" : \"XSK Developer\" , \"role-template-references\" : [ \"$XSAPPNAME.Developer\" ] }, { \"name\" : \"XSK Operator\" , \"description\" : \"XSK Operator\" , \"role-template-references\" : [ \"$XSAPPNAME.Operator\" ] } ] } Replace the <applicationName> placeholder with your application name, e.g. xsk . Create a XSUAA service instance: cf create-service xsuaa application <applicationName>-xsuaa -c xs-security.json Use the same <applicationName> as in the previous step. Deploy XSK: Docker cf push xsk \\ --docker-image=dirigiblelabs/xsk-cf:latest \\ --hostname xsk-<org-name> \\ -m 2G -k 2G Note Replace the <org-name> placeholder with your subaccount's Subdomain value. Instead of using the latest tag (version), for production and development use cases it is recomended to use a stable release version: All released versions can be found here . All XSK Docker images and tags (versions) can be found here . Bind the XSUAA and HANA Cloud service instances to the XSK deployment: cf bind-service xsk <applicationName>-xsuaa cf bind-service xsk <hanaCloudInstanceName> cf set-env xsk HANA_USERNAME <hanaCloudUsername> cf set-env xsk HANA_PASSWORD <hanaCloudPassword> Note Replace the <applicationName> placeholder with the application name used in the previous steps. Replace the <hanaCloudInstanceName> placeholder with the HANA Cloud service instance name that will be used. Replace the <hanaUsername> placeholder with the HANA Cloud username that will be used.
