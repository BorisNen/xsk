Project XSK
===

**Project XSK** is a compatible environment for applications based on [SAP HANA Extended Application Services](https://help.sap.com/viewer/52715f71adba4aaeb480d946c742d1f6/2.0.03/en-US/a6c0749255d84a81a154a7fc87dd33ce.html) (XS). You can deploy it separately from a [SAP HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/hana.html?btp=991d50bf-fa15-4979-ac4b-b280b0eb951f) instance as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.xsk.io/setup/cloud-foundry/), or even [locally](https://www.xsk.io/setup/) in standalone mode. The compatibility stack is an extension of the [Eclipse Dirigible](https://github.com/eclipse/dirigible) cloud development platform.
